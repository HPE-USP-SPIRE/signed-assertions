# SVID-NG
This is the original use case, developed in project phase 1, and reference to ID and anonymous mode, and is depicted in Figure 1.

![Basic scenario](https://github.com/HPE-USP-SPIRE/signed-assertions/blob/main/doc/basicscenario.jpg)

In this scenario, the IdP generates a JWT-like token (SVID-NG) binding the end user with the front-end workload. This token is forwarded until reaches target-wl, where it is validated and finally used in authentication/authorization mechanisms. More details can be found in token specification document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fH8XkOKGXGrWy9uk-JXZbyksHejZ2CfB7h6YXetqG_w
