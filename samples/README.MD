# ID-mode
The workloads uses SPIRE SVID private key to sign the tokens. The user OAuth token is exchanged for an ECDSA assertion, generated by asserting-wl (IdP). Each workload in the application adds new issuer claim with its own public key and audience with next hop public key. and its own signature.  
Together with the token, the workload forward also its trust bundle, allowing for identification and validation offline.

# Anonymous mode
The workloads dont use any IdP. This model do not offer identification of the workloads, but takes advantage of this by using a signature concatenation model that allows for token size reduction and fast validation execution times.
The resulting token is smaller than in ID-mode, as it remove part of the signatures to use as private key. Also, there is no need to send certificates along with the token.

# SVID-NG
The basic model developed in Phase 1 of the project. In this scenario, asserting wl mint a token that allows the delegation of user rights to a workload. The objective of this token (a.k.a. SVID-NG) is to grant that the calling workload have the sufficient rights to access the desired resource. 



As all these scenarios starts with an OAuth token and generates new tokens with restricted rights, the asserting-wl (IdP) have an endpoint that offer a Zero Knowledge Proof that it have a valid OAuth token behind the call.
